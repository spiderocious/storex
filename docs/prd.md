# File Service Infrastructure - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

The File Service Infrastructure is a centralized backend service that provides secure, scalable file storage and management capabilities for all applications within the organization. This service eliminates the need for individual applications to implement their own file handling systems, reducing development time and ensuring consistent behavior across the organization.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Multiple applications across the organization implement their own file storage solutions
- Inconsistent file handling approaches lead to security vulnerabilities and maintenance overhead
- Duplication of effort in implementing upload, download, and file management features
- No centralized visibility into file usage and storage costs
- Lack of standardized file access controls and audit trails

### Pain Points
1. **Development Inefficiency**: Teams spend time building file storage instead of core features
2. **Security Risks**: Inconsistent security implementations across applications
3. **Cost Visibility**: No unified view of file storage costs and usage patterns
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Multiple file storage implementations to maintain and update
5. **Compliance Challenges**: Difficult to ensure consistent compliance across all file operations

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Centralization**: Provide a single, reusable file service for the entire organization
2. **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms
3. **Scalability**: Handle growing file storage needs across all applications
4. **Developer Experience**: Simple, well-documented API that reduces integration time

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 80% of new applications use the file service within 6 months
- **Development Time Reduction**: 50% reduction in time spent implementing file features
- **Security Incidents**: Zero file-related security incidents
- **API Performance**: 99.9% uptime with <200ms average response time
- **Cost Optimization**: 30% reduction in overall file storage costs through centralization

## Target Users

### Primary Users
1. **Backend Developers**: Integrate file operations into their applications
2. **DevOps Engineers**: Deploy and maintain the file service infrastructure
3. **System Administrators**: Manage buckets, users, and monitor usage

### Secondary Users
1. **Frontend Developers**: Use file upload/download URLs in client applications
2. **Product Managers**: Review usage analytics and storage metrics
